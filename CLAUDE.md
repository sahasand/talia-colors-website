## Project Overview

This is a sophisticated hair colorist website featuring an AI-powered color recommendation system with full mobile responsiveness and multi-language support. The main application provides a complete user journey from photo upload through personalized color analysis and appointment booking, optimized for seamless experience across all devices from smartphones to desktops. The site is fully internationalized supporting Portuguese (default), Spanish, and English locales.

## Architecture

**Next.js 15 App Router Structure with Internationalization**
- Uses modern App Router architecture (not Pages Router) with next-intl for i18n
- `/app` directory contains all routes and layouts with locale-based routing
- `app/layout.tsx` - Root layout that redirects to default locale
- `app/page.tsx` - Root page that redirects to default locale (Portuguese)
- `app/[locale]/layout.tsx` - Localized layout with Geist font loading, metadata, and NextIntlClientProvider
- `app/[locale]/page.tsx` - Main localized page orchestrating all sections
- `app/globals.css` - Global styles with Tailwind CSS v4
- `src/i18n/routing.ts` - Internationalization routing configuration
- `messages/` - Translation files for pt.json, es.json, en.json

- Custom CSS properties for theming
- Mobile-first responsive utilities in globals.css
- Touch-optimized interaction styles
- Responsive container padding and spacing
- Mobile-specific scrollbar optimizations

**State Management**
- Local component state (no global state management)
- Photo and questionnaire data passed through props
- Step-based workflow with clear progression
- Form validation and error handling

**Integration Points**
- WhatsApp booking with pre-filled messages and locale-specific contact information

- Memory management is critical for camera and file operations
- Blob URLs created in PhotoUpload persist until AIColorPickerSection cleanup to ensure image loads in ColorRecommendations

## Business Logic

**AI Color Analysis Simulation**
- Sophisticated filtering based on questionnaire responses
- Confidence scoring and suitability matching
- Single "perfect" recommendation approach (highest confidence)
- Realistic processing delays for better UX

**User Journey**

**3D Carousel Technical Implementation**
- **Dynamic Position Algorithm**: `calculateImagePosition(imageIndex, totalImages, currentIndex)` using trigonometric functions
- **Circular Mathematics**: `angle = (relativeIndex / totalImages) * Math.PI * 2` for precise positioning
- **Responsive Scaling**: `radiusX/radiusZ` adapt based on device type (mobile: 120px, tablet: 160px, desktop: 200px)
- **Spring Physics**: 1.5-second transitions with stiffness: 60, damping: 25 for natural movement
- **Memory Management**: `useCallback` for position calculator, proper dependency arrays for optimization
- **Touch Integration**: Velocity-based haptic feedback, conflict prevention, enhanced touch targets

**Key Integrations**
