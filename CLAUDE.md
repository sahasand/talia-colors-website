## Project Overview

This is a sophisticated hair colorist website featuring an AI-powered color recommendation system with full mobile responsiveness and multi-language support. The main application provides a complete user journey from photo upload through personalized color analysis and appointment booking, optimized for seamless experience across all devices from smartphones to desktops. The site is fully internationalized supporting Portuguese (default), Spanish, and English locales.

## Architecture

**Next.js 15 App Router Structure with Internationalization**
- Uses modern App Router architecture (not Pages Router) with next-intl for i18n
- `/app` directory contains all routes and layouts with locale-based routing
- `app/layout.tsx` - Root layout that redirects to default locale
- `app/page.tsx` - Root page that redirects to default locale (Portuguese)
- `app/[locale]/layout.tsx` - Localized layout with Geist font loading, metadata, and NextIntlClientProvider
- `app/[locale]/page.tsx` - Main localized page orchestrating all sections
- `app/globals.css` - Global styles with Tailwind CSS v4
- `src/i18n/routing.ts` - Internationalization routing configuration
- `messages/` - Translation files for pt.json, es.json, en.json

- Proper state management for multi-step workflows
- Resource cleanup with useEffect hooks
- Error boundaries for component-level error handling

**TypeScript Patterns**
- Comprehensive interface definitions in `types.ts`
- Type-safe prop passing between components
- Union types for workflow steps and categories
- Strict mode enabled for build-time error catching

**Animation Patterns**
- Framer Motion for all animations with mobile performance considerations
- Consistent entrance/exit transitions across all screen sizes
- Staggered animations with appropriate delays
- Micro-interactions for enhanced UX
- Reduced motion support for mobile performance and accessibility

**Responsive Design Patterns**
- Mobile-first breakpoint strategy (sm: 640px, md: 768px, lg: 1024px, xl: 1280px)
- Progressive enhancement from mobile to desktop
- Touch-friendly minimum sizing (44px touch targets)
- Conditional content rendering for optimal mobile UX
- Responsive typography with proper scaling ratios
- Flexible grid systems that adapt to screen size

**Performance Optimizations**
- Proper memory cleanup for blob URLs and camera streams
- Blob URL lifecycle managed by AIColorPickerSection (not PhotoUpload) to prevent premature cleanup
- Next.js Image component for optimized image loading with responsive sizing
- Suspense boundaries for loading states
- Efficient re-renders with proper dependency arrays and React Hook optimizations
- Mobile-specific performance optimizations (reduced shadows, optimized animations)
- Touch interaction debouncing for better mobile performance
- Responsive image loading with appropriate sizes for different devices
- **React Performance Patterns:**
  - `useMemo` for expensive calculations (questions array, top recommendations)
  - `useCallback` for event handlers and utility functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - Proper dependency arrays to ensure optimal memoization
  - Hook ordering compliance to follow Rules of Hooks
  - Memoized component functions for complex UI components

## Development Notes

**Styling**
- Font variables available as `--font-geist-sans` and `--font-geist-mono`
- Dark mode support built into CSS with media queries
- Gradient-based color system for brand consistency
- Custom CSS properties for theming
- Mobile-first responsive utilities in globals.css
- Touch-optimized interaction styles
- Responsive container padding and spacing
- Mobile-specific scrollbar optimizations

**State Management**
- Local component state (no global state management)
- Photo and questionnaire data passed through props
- Step-based workflow with clear progression
- Form validation and error handling

**Integration Points**
- WhatsApp booking with pre-filled messages and locale-specific contact information
- Camera API for selfie capture with enhanced permissions
- File system API for photo uploads
- Responsive image handling for user photos
- Advanced image optimization pipeline (AVIF, WebP formats)

- Image optimization warnings for blob URLs are expected (user-uploaded content)
- Memory management is critical for camera and file operations
- Blob URLs created in PhotoUpload persist until AIColorPickerSection cleanup to ensure image loads in ColorRecommendations
- **Current Hero Images**: Uses 1a.png through 11a.png (11 total images) - older img1-6.png and transform1-3.png are legacy backups
- **Active Hero Component**: HeroSectionSimple.tsx is the current implementation with advanced effects
- **Mobile Viewport Priority**: All layout optimizations prioritize mobile-first design with viewport constraint handling

## Business Logic

**AI Color Analysis Simulation**
- Sophisticated filtering based on questionnaire responses
- Confidence scoring and suitability matching
- Single "perfect" recommendation approach (highest confidence)
- Realistic processing delays for better UX

**User Journey**

**Mobile User Experience Considerations**
- Seamless photo upload from mobile camera or gallery
- Touch-friendly questionnaire with single-column layout
- Responsive progress indicators and step navigation
- Mobile-optimized booking flow with pre-filled WhatsApp messages

**3D Carousel Technical Implementation**
- **Dynamic Position Algorithm**: `calculateImagePosition(imageIndex, totalImages, currentIndex)` using trigonometric functions
